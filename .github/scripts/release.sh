# that already exists (for example written by hand with release notes) gets the zip and checksum
# only when it has no zip yet; a release with a zip is left alone, because a new build of the same
# code is a different file (timestamps) and its checksum would not match the attached zip.
#
# Usage: release.sh <tag, e.g. v1.0.6>. Needs GH_TOKEN. DRY_RUN=1 prints instead of doing.
